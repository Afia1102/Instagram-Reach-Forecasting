This project forecasts Instagram reach using time series analysis. It starts with data exploration and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis to understand reach trends and patterns. The SARIMA model is chosen for forecasting, with parameters determined through autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots. Predictions are generated and visualized alongside training data. The repository includes data files, a Jupyter Notebook with code, and a README with usage instructions.
